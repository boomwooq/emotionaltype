FONTLOG for Emotional fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Emotional Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Emotional fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Emotional font is part of Promphan Suksumek’s Master Thesis in Visual Communication, Basel School of Design, HGK-FHNW. This font aimed to be use for expressing emotion in a text message, not to be compared with emojis or emoticons, it was aimed to be used in semi-formal levels such as in the workplace or the situation where you would like to express emotion/ tone of voice but not in the personal level. To indicate negativity and positivity in text, the letterforms were manipulated by applying more angularity and curvature respectively. It was positioned between expressive handwriting and typography. For more explanation and details, please see  www.emotionaltype.org and the process documentation, which could be linked directly from the site.

Emotional family is not a complete font; the typeface itself has not yet been fully developed, and now the font here only contains nine latin letters— a, e, i, l, m, n, o and t.
